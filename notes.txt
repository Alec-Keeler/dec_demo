How to define a route handler
    What is the HTTP method?
        app methods:
        get(), post(), put(), patch(), delete()
        all(), use()
    What is the path?
        string, array of strings
            '/test', ['/test', '/try'], Regular Expressions
    Middleware??
        optional
    Define a response
        send(), // if passed a string, will send a string response, otherwise converts to json
        json(), // always responds with json
        status(), redirect(), render()
    
How do we take user input?
    req.body
        requires app.use(express.json())
        Often used for taking in form data
    req.params
        defined in end point path
        adds property of that name to req.params
    req.query
        optional additions to a request
        typically used for conditionally augmenting search queries

Route order matters!
    Express runs top to bottom
        A request checks every endpoint to see if it's a match
    Most specific at the top, dynamic below
